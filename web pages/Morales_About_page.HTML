        <div><h2 style="text-align:center"> ABOUT </h2><p>Lifelong learner and avid story collector
            Millistoria literally means a thousand stories. 
            It is my hope that through this site, I can share 
            the stories that have brought me and countless others 
            so much joy and insight. May we never stop telling others
             our story or stop listening to the stories of others.
            A mother of 5 and a grandmother of 4, Janine Malavasi 
            has a long career in education and has used her 
            extensive experience in the field to begin creating 
            her own works of writing. Always an avid reader and 
            always ready to listen, Janine has been a bedrock for 
            her family and friends whenever they are in need of 
            reliability and help as she never abandons or shies 
            away from an issue or hardship. With a love for space 
            and the prospects of what we can learn from space travel 
            and study, Janine is the first one to be at a shuttle 
            launch to marvel at the feats that humans have accomplished 
            and speculate what new things can and will be achieved by 
            the mission as it launches beyond site. She is easily 
            inspired but is also able to stick to what she sets her 
            mind on with the goals often being quite ambitious. She 
            is a huge influence to her students and children on how 
            to be persistent and hardworking while being caring and 
            empathetic as well. As she accomplishes her dreams and 
            goals of travel and spending more time out in nature and 
            with her family, she continues to be a role model for 
            everyone around her.

                <h4>1.	What was your dream career growing up?</h4><br> 
                Writing has always been something I have found to be both challenging and rewarding. As such, it was the first career I considered when the thought of working for a living first crossed my mind. My ambition seemed possible in the spring of my senior year in high school when I was accepted to study writing at Barnard College of Columbia University. Family decisions and circumstances led to me to dismiss that dream and I chose a more “practical” career as a Business major. Ironically, I found an opportunity to revisit that dream years later after the “Great Recession” and once again pursued writing, but this time as an English major at a local university in Palm Beach. My continuing education ultimately led to my present career as a full-time educator. As an English teacher, I am able to fulfill my dream every single day by helping others to both learn and enjoy writing.
            <br>
                <h4>2.	Is this still your dream career and if not what is it now?</h4><br>
                I am happy to say that writing is part of all I do and part of anything I have planned to do in the future since no one can honestly say that writing is not critical to every possible career. 
            <br>    
                <h4>3.	What has been your greatest influence in life (person or event)?</h4><br>
                Without a doubt, I would never have become the person I am today without my parents. Both collectively and individually, they have shaped my view of the world and how best to live my life. My father was my first storyteller and helped me to love reading, writing, and all stories both from the past and those we write ourselves. His charisma and speaking skills made him a role model for my social interactions and his family commitment, one I hold in high esteem to this day. His choice to marry what one might consider his opposite, led to some “interesting” family memories, but in retrospect, I can confidently say that he and my mother were a perfect match. Her artistic qualities fulfilled his love and desire for art, both musical and visual, and her need for both structure and leadership were perfectly matched to my father’s engineering mind and business sense. Together they raised four children who learned the value of respect, responsibility, and endurance because through it all, my parents never, ever gave up and solved their problems by staying committed to their family, and by seeking education from others. I owe them my life and all my successes are because of them. 
            <br>  
                <h4>4.	What are your top 5 films?</h4><br> 
                This is such a difficult question as I love so many films for different reasons. My taste is quite eclectic, but I will say I have a few that have a special place in my heart for one reason or another.
                <br>
                Number 1 has to be Gallipoli because it taught me about the tragedy of war. I left the theater feeling like the world would never be the same for me, and it hasn’t.
                <br>
                Number 2 would be Disney’s The Little Mermaid since at the time, my daughter was having open-heart surgery and this film was her way of escaping and my way of helping her get through the harsh reality and pain of life at that time.
                <br>
                Number 3 is Giant, the 1956 Western. I have a fondness for The Old West and the sweeping vistas of this movie along with the impeccable acting and saga of a family stand out to me as one of the greatest films.
                <br>
                Number 4 is probably not one I would recommend to students under 17, but is one of the only movies I have stood on the edge of my seat watching for the entire film. The Departed is entirely out of “my kind” of movie, but it is so well written and also one of my children’s favorites which is what led me to watch it in the first place. 
                <br>
                Number 5 is tough, but I will have to include one of my favorite authors in this list, so despite having changed the title from its original text, I will add the 1957 film, Witness for the Prosecution. This thriller was the first film I showed my students after having started reading a collection of plays by Agatha Christie. Not only does it have some of the most recognizable actors in Hollywood history, but it clearly teaches its viewers that all of us can possess a virtually undetectable dark side; something all of us must learn. 
            <br>   
                <h4>5.	How did you discover your current hobbies?</h4><br>
                Not surprisingly, I discovered my love for cooking in a middle school Home Economics class. Despite having been raised by a family of cooks on my mother’s side, I had never really taken an interest in cooking beyond my early days with an Easy Bake Oven. The realization that anyone can cook with the help of a well-written and tested recipe seemed magical to me and led me to not only start cooking for my family and friends, but to my current collection of recipe books.
            <br>  
                <h4>6.	What is the greatest thing you've learned from your schooling?</h4><br>
                Probably the most important thing school has taught me is that learning leads to questions that lead to answers, which often lead to more questions. The idea that we must first learn something in order to question it is imperative to me. A simple observation is the first step to learning and from there we must not stop. Questions are the hallmark of education and research is the catalyst to more questions. 
            <br>    
                <h4>7.	What impact do you think you've made on the lives of others?</h4><br>
                I am lucky to have actually learned the impact of my life on others while I am still making one. Educators have the privilege of shaping the lives of others. Students will often come back to share just how much of an impact a teacher has made. There is no better reward in life than to learn that you have left a lasting impression on another person and that the person is grateful for you having been a part of their life.
            <br>   
                <h4>8.	What is your favorite food?</h4><br>
                What a terrible question for a cook! I cannot answer that, but once I had to choose sides on a pizza or taco and ended up with pizza, so I guess that might be eat, but honestly, it changes every month. Lately I have been really enjoying Asian food meaning food with lots of vegetables and spices since I am mainly vegan. 
            <br>    
                <h4>9.	Other than your hobbies, what is an activity that you enjoy recreationally?</h4><br>
                As long as I can remember, I have loved listening to stories. Over time, I have come to believe that learning the story behind something or someone, often leads to a better understanding and appreciation of not only that person, event, object, or situation, but also ourselves with one caveat. This warning has been made clear through the illuminating words of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Simply put: there is never just one story. We, the world, and all of our history are intertwined and as a result, there will always be thousands of stories to be told and thousands of stories to be heard.
            <br>   
                <h4>10.	Do you feel hopeful about the future?</h4><br>
                Yes. I have to be as a teacher, since all I do is prepare kids for a world I may not be a part of and I honestly want to make the best it can be. What gives me the most hope, though, are my children. The desire to make their future better and to never let them give up on their dreams is what I strive for every day.
